          <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> has... you guessed it! A free code camp! Actually they have several paths to choose from. A few front-end ones are: responsive web design, front-end libraries. They also have a fantastic <a href="https://youtube.com/freecodecamp" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> chock full of videos.</a>
          <p>I just discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ" target="_blank">Coder Coder</a>. She focuses on front-end HTML and CSS</p>
          <p>I really love <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/" target="_blank">skillshare</a> for classes on front-end web development and design, UX, UI, and branding. It's a monthly subscription that costs $15 a month. They have some <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/browse/free-classes" target="_blank">free classes</a> too</p>
          <p><a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, the javascript version of the processing library that is taught in the creative coding class is a fun way to add animations to your websites.</p>
          <p>You can buy your own custom domain and hook it up to github pages! Yep! For like less than $10 a year, you can have a free website. Here's <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages" target="_blank">how to set it up if you register with namecheap</a>. Here's <a href="https://medium.com/@steve_jones/4-how-to-point-a-domain-on-google-domains-to-github-pages-1d4c24f01382" target="_blank">how to set it up if you register through google domains</a>.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LearnWebCode" target="_blank">LearnWebCode</a> has a Learn HTML, Learn CSS, and Learn JQuery and Javascript playlist on his YouTube channel.</p>

          <p><strong>Write: Design journal prompt:</strong> This one's about "why." Read this article (try to pretend it's not a cheezy article about business success). Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article. OR If that's too challenging right now, consider people in your life or people who've inspired you. Think about what drives them, what their "why" is. Why did they work so hard to do XYZ, was it from past experiences they had, was it because they saw a need they were called to fill? What's their deeper "why?" Ask them if you know them, or look up some biographical information and try to figure it out. Write about either you or your inspiration.</p>

          <p>Add an inspiring site of the week. This one's not a site, but I love the idea of a vector illustration a day and I like that she did them in series'. <a href="https://medium.com/the-100-day-project/100-days-of-vector-illustration-6f2f10209b0b" target="_blank">https://medium.com/the-100-day-project/100-days-of-vector-illustration-6f2f10209b0b</a></p>
